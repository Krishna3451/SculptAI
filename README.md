## Cloud Storage Implementation

SculptAI now uses Google Cloud Storage to store videos and audio files. This provides:

- Improved scalability and reliability
- Accessibility from anywhere
- Reduced server storage requirements

See [README-cloud-storage.md](SculptAI-backend/README-cloud-storage.md) for full implementation details.
